1.1 Background
People usually go to Touch cinema to watch movies. There are about 300 - 400 people going to 
the cinema, purchasing tickets, popcorn and drinkings everyday. However, people have to go all their ways
to the cinema to buy tickets, that could lead to some disadvantages for the customers such as:
 +To get information about movie schedules or movies that will be performed, they must go to the cinema or see in posters, banners,...
 +Not knowing neither the status of the ticket nor the promotions until the customers come to the cinema. 
	For example, they want to see "Deadpool 2" at 8:00pm, and they arrive at the cinema at 7:50pm, and unfornately, all ticket are sold out.
 +At the high peak time or when there is a blockbuster film (phim bom tấn), the customers have to make such long queues, which makes the cinema crowded and unsecurity.
 +The traditional ticket is made from paper, which is easily lost or damaged. Moreover, to make fake tickets is not a dificult problem.
 +The customers can't choose seats they want in advanced.
1.2 Business oppoturnity
Many customers have requested a system that would permit
a user to book tickets online.Such a system would save customers' time,
and it would increase the chance of getting information about the current promotions.
The more convenient way of booking tickets, the more customers have an urge of going to
the theater. With the dramatical development of E-Commerce, this system is expected to
help Touch cinema gain more profit and customers adapt the current technology.
